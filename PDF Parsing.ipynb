Theref ore, investors always try to minimize risk while maximizing \\ntheir returns as well. In the other words, individual investment strategies \\ndepend s on how heavily the risk they can take to achieve the expected results.  \\nClassically, the risk can be measured by the standard deviation of expected \\nreturns. For that reason, when investors take more risks, the profits or losses will \\nalso increase. Therefore, to avoid this risk investors choose some stocks with the \\nsmallest variant in their portfolio investment. This technique is called portfolio \\noptimization which has been widely used for years in the industry of capital \\nmarket and financial analysis (Mayanja, Mataramyura, & Charles, 2013) .  \\nMarkowitz in 1952 was officially the first introduced theory of portfolio \\noptimization, then gradually become the most efficient technique in portfolio \\npreparation and continuously developed until today. This model support \\ninvestors how to reduce risk and analyzing the various possible portfolios by \\nchoosing some stock market are n ot “moving” together (Markowitz, 1952) . In \\nPrincipal, the Markowitz Mean -Variance (MV) is a quadratic model, where the \\nvariance of each stock is adjusted to measure the risk (Xu, Zhou, Jiang, Yu, & Niu, \\n2016) . This is related to the habit of investors, whi ch is more often think of \\nrationality and is reluctant to take risks (avoid risk).
